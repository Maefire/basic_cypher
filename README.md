# basic_cypher
This is aimed as my first small Ruby project. I suppose it is mainly to get me into the flow of working with Ruby, more than learning anything new. All I should require from anyone running this program would be inputs for your message, and how many letters over you would like to shift the message.

If you come across any oddities, then let me know. I am always interested in solving a problem.
